Movable Type Plugin: Template Callbacks
---------------------------------------

This is a proof-of-concept plugin. It defines the concept of 'Callbacks' inside a template.

It works for Static Publishing and Dynamic Publishing

TAGS
----

If offers three tags:

<$mt:TemplateCallback name="callback name" [priority="5"] $>

This runs all the callbacks for the given name
Examples for names: "verytop", "siderbar_primary sidebar_secondary"
Priority: can be either a number, (i.e. "5") or a range ("3..7"). 
Will execute only the callback with these priorities. If no priority is given, 
will execute all the callbacks for this callback name

<mt:SetTemplateCallback name="callback name" [priority="5"] $>
   ... template code ...
</mt:SetTemplateCallback>

This set a callback for a given name, and priority. 
if no priority was given, 5 is the default

<mt:AreCallbacksRegistred name="callback name">
</mt:AreCallbacksRegistred>

A conditional block, running only if any callback was registered for this name

At the start of the template, please add these lines:

<$mt:var name="callback_prefix" value="publish"$>
<$mt:var name="callback_postfix" value="entry"$>

This specifies the callbacks application and in which page we are now

Callback Names
--------------

A typical callback name is: "publish.verytop.index"
It goes from the application, to the position, and to the specific page name.
In this case, callbacks registered to the following names will be run:
"publish", "publish.verytop" and "publish.verytop.index"

So callback registred to "publish.verytop" will appear in the very top 
of all the pages.

Registering a global Callback
-----------------------------

In your plugin directory, create directory: tmpl/callbacks

In this directory, the files sould be named "<cb_name>.<priority>.tmpl". i.e.

  publish.sidebar_primary.2.tmpl

Will register a callback for all blogs, callback name "publish.sidebar_primary",
priority 2

Another example:

  publish.banner.entry.5.tmpl

Will be added to the banner only in the entry pages, with priority 5

Registering a Callback on the DB
--------------------------------

Create and save a template object, with the following parameters:

  my $tmpl = $app->model('template')->new();
  $tmpl->type('t_callback');
  $tmpl->name('verytop.entry');
  $tmpl->blog_id(0);
  $tmpl->text('<h1>this is a callback</h1>');
  $tmpl->build_interval(5);
  $tmpl->identifier('publish');
  $tmpl->save() or die "failed to save tmpl";

Notes: 
* name can also be "plugin_id::verytop.entry", which will be activated only if the plugin is installed
* blog_id can be 0 or a specific blog number.
* the identifier specify for which application this callback is directed. currently, only 'publish' exists.

If this callback is setting-depended, you can do it on setting-saving, in the following callbacks:

callbacks:
    MT::PluginData::pre_save: $Plugin::Module::plugin_data_pre_save
    save_config_filter.Plugin_Id: $Plugin::Module::register_callbacks

Where the first callback will work for older MT installations, and the second is prefered for new MT versions.

Widgets
-------

The widgets are automatically loaded into these callbacks: 
"publish.sidebar_primary" and "publish.sidebar_secondary", 
with priorities from 3 to 7. If there is only one sidebar, 
they will be mixed together, ordered by priority.

Note: this is the only case of callbacks with non-integer priority. oops.

The mt:widgets tag have another attribute: callback. it is the name of the callback to load the widgets
on, and to excecute. If there are more then one callback in the attribute, the widgets will be loaded
on the first callback, and all the callbacks will be excecuted. examples:

  <$mt:WidgetSet 
    name="<__trans phrase="3-column layout - Primary Sidebar">" 
    callback="sidebar_primary"$>
  <$mt:WidgetSet 
    name="<__trans phrase="2-column layout - Sidebar">" 
    callback="sidebar_primary sidebar_secondary"$>

If a callback attribute is not present, the widgets will be displayed normally, and no callback
will not be called

Themes
------

The attached themes are a copy of the classic blog and website themes supplied by
default with Movable Type. They were modified to support callbacks.

The following callbacks are used:
before_content, after_content, above_footer, footer, verybuttom, 
verytop, banner, below_banner, htmlhead, between_content.entry_summary,
sidebar_secondary, sidebar_primary, after_content, before_content

The following screen-names are used:
archive_index, category_entry_listing, comment_preview, comment_response, dynamic_error, 
entry, main_index, monthly_entry_listing, page search_results

TODO
----

In Dynamic Publishing, add support for ignoring callbacks from plugins that were uninstalled or deactivated
